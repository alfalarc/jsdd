# GitHub

Even if there are other places existing, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is our natural choice to store our git-managed collaborative work online.

- [Begin your existence on GitHub](https://github.com/signup/free): having a membership at github.com allows you to store your own work, contribute to other projects, fork repositories, ...

- [Submit and resolve an issue](github-submit-and-resolve-an-issue.md)

- [Pull request workflow](github-pull-request-worflow.md) -- ***TODO***

- [Repo management: create, invite collaborators, fork, clone, ...](github-repository-management.md) -- ***TODO***
