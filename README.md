# Development documentation

This repo gathers all Neurone6 development workflows and processes.

## Make your own documentation

Writing down documentation whenever you find a way to do something new is a good way to memorize and learn.

### Markdown

We use the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (.md files) to write down our documentation.
However stated so on [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), it seems that GitHub basic .md files display doesn't totally apply the GitHub Flavored Markdown (or GFM) syntax, hence a double paragraph character is necessary to display separated lines.

You may want to visualize your markdown files before pushing them online:

- [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview/jmchmkecamhbiokiopfpnfgbidieafmd?hl=en) (click on FREE+ at top-right to install)

- [Windows installer](https://bitbucket.org/wcoenen/downmarker/downloads)

- [Mac version]() (any mac-using developer out there ?)

## Versioning your collaborative work with Git and GitHub

Here is a list of guidelines to how we manage collaborative work at Neurone6, using the excellent versioning tools Git and GitHub provide.

----
### Git

#### Start working with Git

You should really read at least the first three chapters of the wonderful and extensive online book on [Understanding Git](http://git-scm.com/documentation) by Scott Chacon.

In particular, the following pages are strongly recommended:

- [What is version control](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

- [Install and startup working with Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

- [Git basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)

- **[Interactive cheatsheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html)**

#### Some specific tasks detailed:

- [How to ignore mistakingly tracked files](https://github.com/neurone6/devdoc/blob/master/versioning/ignore_mistakingly_tracked_files.md)

#### Git workflows

For medium to large-scale projects, we use the [Git Flow branching model](http://pygmeeweb.com/2013/09/02/git-the-gitflow-way.html).

- **[Cheatsheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)**

-----
### GitHub

Even if there are other places existing, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is our natural choice to store our collaborative work online.

- [Begin your existence on GitHub](https://github.com/signup/free): having a membership at github.com allows you to store your own work, contribute to other projects, fork repositories, ...

- [Submit and resolve a bug](https://github.com/neurone6/devdoc/blob/master/versioning/bug_submit_and_resolve.md)

- [Pull request workflow](https://github.com/neurone6/devdoc/blob/master/versioning/pull_request_worflow.md)

- [Repo management: create, invite collaborators, fork, clone, ...](https://github.com/neurone6/devdoc/blob/master/versioning/repositories_management.md)
